# üí≠ | What is this repository for?
This reposiroty is for you, the **Hawking's** community! <br>
You can navigate through the folders and help me to reach more languages translating the bot's files.

Currently the bot supports:
- es-US
- en-US

# üåé | Why more languages?
I've always wanted **Hawking's** to be that bot everyone loves to use. For this to be true, the bot should be translated into more than just two languages.
The **Hawking's** community is very important for me, and having multiple language translations makes the bot more user friendly, easy to understand and more complete!

# ‚òùüèº | How can i help?
Just download the file you want to translate/fix/update. Once you want your contribution to be implemented into **Hawking's** create a ` Pull Request ` and wait until me or some other helpers accept your request.

Once your request gets accepted, the changes you just made will be available into **Hawking's**!
